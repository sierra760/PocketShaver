 *  Master compile-time switch for NQD, RAVE, GL, and DSp diagnostic logging.
 *  When ACCEL_LOGGING_ENABLED is 1: all subsystem logging macros
 *  (RAVE_LOG, GL_LOG, GL_METAL_LOG, NQD_LOG) compile in and are controlled
 *  by their respective runtime bools.
 *  When ACCEL_LOGGING_ENABLED is 0 (default): all diagnostic logging compiles to
 *  zero-cost no-ops, runtime bools become compile-time false for dead-code
 *  elimination, and Apple-specific os_log imports/objects are excluded.
 *  NQD_ERR (always-on error logging) is NOT gated by this flag.
