 *  rave_metal_renderer.h. Every DSp back-buffer uses MTLStorageModeShared,
 *  allocated through the bump sub-allocator on kHeapCompositor.
 *
 *  Compositor-blindness preserved: DSp emits a CompositeLayer POD with
 *  slot=kLayerSlotFramebuffer — compositor sees the slot + source handle
 *  only, never the engine identity.

 *    - ctx->dirty_empty -> full-buffer blit (PDF p.38: zero Inval calls
 *      between SwapBuffers means the entire back-buffer is dirty).

 *      blit (coverage threshold; sub-rect encoder setup cost does not

 *  Full present-to-framebuffer helper that picks the right Metal encoder
 *  based on whether ctx->back_texture and framebuffer_texture share a
 *  pixel format.
 *
 *    - Same format (e.g. both BGRA8Unorm at 32 bpp): opens a single blit
 *      command encoder on `command_buffer` and delegates to
 *      DSpEncodeBackBufferBlit. This is the 32 bpp Sims fast path.
 *
 *    - Different format (e.g. back_texture R16Uint at 16 bpp into the
 *      compositor's BGRA8Unorm framebuffer): runs a DSp-owned full-screen
 *      render pass that samples back_texture in its native pixel format
 *      and writes BGRA8Unorm to framebuffer_texture. The fragment shader
 *      source is compiled in dsp_metal_renderer.mm (DSp engine side — no
 *      new symbols in metal_compositor.{h,mm} or compositor_shaders.metal).
 *
 *  This replaces the bare `[blit copyFromTexture: ... toTexture: ...]`
 *  path that Sims's 1024x768@16bpp mode tripped on Catalyst (Metal debug
 *  blit validation rejects pixel-format-incompatible copies).
 *
 *  command_buffer is id<MTLCommandBuffer> as void*; framebuffer_texture
 *  is id<MTLTexture> as void*. The function opens/closes its own encoder
 *  on `command_buffer`; the caller is responsible for [cb commit].
 *
 *  Dirty-state reset semantics match DSpEncodeBackBufferBlit
 *  (ctx->dirty_empty = true, ctx->dirty_cold_start = false, dirty bounds
 *  zeroed) on every successful encode.
 *
 *  Currently supports 16 bpp (R16Uint xRGB1555 -> BGRA8Unorm) and 32 bpp
 *  (BGRA8Unorm matched-format blit). 1/2/4/8 bpp indexed depths require
 *  palette + gamma uniforms (compositor_fragment_indexed precedent); a
 *  follow-up task adds those. For now the
 *  helper logs and falls back to the bare blit (which the Metal debug
 *  layer will reject) when an unsupported format pair is encountered, so
 *  the regression surfaces loudly rather than silently producing wrong
 *  output.
