 *  C++ callable interface for the Display-Mode Controller (DMC), the
 *  authoritative writer of display state. Returns
 *  int/void so this header can be included from plain .cpp files without
 *  pulling in ObjC or Metal types. Not PPC-callable - no NATIVE_* opcode
 *  dispatch; callers are native C++/Obj-C++ code (video_sdl2.cpp,
 *  video.cpp, metal_compositor.mm, rave_metal_renderer.mm, gl_engine.cpp).
 *
 *  The controller owns a 4-state finite-state machine
 *  (Quiescent / QuickDrawOwner / ThreeDOwner / Transitioning / Blanking)
 *  with 12 legal transitions T1..T12. Every illegal transition returns a named kDMCErr* code with
 *  no silent state mutation.
