 *
 *  Per-engine MTLHeap sub-allocator, PSO cache, LRU purgeable list,
 *  three-tier eviction pipeline, ring buffer primitive, and
 *  memory-warning C shim entry point.
 *
 *  Design notes:
 *    - Separate module from gfxaccel_resources.{h,cpp,mm}.
 *    - Five MTLHeaps (NQD / RAVE / GL / Compositor / DSp).
 *    - iOS 17+ -> MTLHeapTypePlacement; 13.4-16.x -> Automatic.
 *    - Per-heap ceilings (32 / 128 / 96 / 48 / 32 MiB).
 *    - Heap creation is lazy (first use, not init).
 *    - Bump reset is legal only when the heap has no live sub-allocations.
 *    - Three-tier eviction: LRU purge -> PSO flush -> loud assert.
 *    - Memory-warning C shim called from Swift observer.
 *    - Compositor handshake via dispatch_semaphore.
 *    - In-memory PSO cache (std::unordered_map).
 *    - Engine attach/detach plugs into the resource fan-out.
 *
 *  Threading: single-writer from PPC emul thread. Memory-warning
 *  handler marshals main -> emul via dispatch_async onto a serial queue
 *  owned by this module. NO std::mutex, NO std::atomic.
 *
 *  C-callable throughout: the header can be included from .cpp, .mm, or
 *  Swift-via-bridging-header without pulling in Metal types; id<MTLHeap>,
 *  id<MTLBuffer>, id<MTLTexture> return values are exposed as void* and
 *  bridge-cast inside the .mm implementation.
